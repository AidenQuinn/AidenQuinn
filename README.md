## About me

I'm a technical support engineer with 5 years of experience and a specialization in Billing & Identity Access Management (IAM). 

While sitting with Sales, Customer Success, Engineering, and Global Support teams in various roles [@Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox), I was a key contributor to cross-departmental collaborations such as Pricing model changes, Data Privacy initiatives, our Single Sign on Product launch, ToS compliance, Fraud detection, and IT / Security rollouts. 

I was responsible for end-to-end ticket resolution for more than 2,000 tickets / year, in the following domains:

- SAML Single Sign-on (SSO) setup
- Access Token scopes, restrictions
- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
- Account lockout procedures
- Email deliverability, automation
- Cost forecasting / management
- GDPR / CCPA, DPA requests
- Pricing model comparisons
- Net 30 ACH invoicing
- Discount policies
- Fraud detection
- ToS compliance
