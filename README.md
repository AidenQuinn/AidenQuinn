## About me

I'm a technical support engineer with a specialization in Billing & Identity Access Management (IAM) who is transitioning into IT.

Over 5+ years [@Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox) in various roles (Support, Customer Success, Product Management, and Sales), I was a key contributor to cross-departmental collaborations such as product launches & deprecations, pricing changes, service compliance, and fraud/abuse detection.
