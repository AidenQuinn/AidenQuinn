<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Aiden ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm a Technical Support Engineer with a specialization in Billing, Identity & Access Management (IAM). I'm currently working on my CompTIA A+ certification (expected 11/2022) and am transitioning into IT Support / HelpDesk. 

Over 5+ years [@Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox) in various roles (Support, Customer Success, Product Management, and Sales), I'm grateful to have been involved in high-impact, cross-departmental collaborations such as product launches, feature deprecations, pricing changes, service compliance, and fraud/abuse detection.

I'm Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) certified.
