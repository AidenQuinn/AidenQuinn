## About me

I'm a technical support engineer with 5 years of experience and a specialization in Billing & Identity Access Management (IAM). 

While sitting with Sales, Customer Success, Engineering, and Global Support teams in various roles [@Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox), I was a key contributor to cross-departmental collaborations such as Pricing model changes, Data Privacy initiatives, our Single Sign on Product launch, ToS compliance, Fraud detection, and IT / Security rollouts.

### Areas of ownership

As our Billing & IAM lead, I owned end-to-end ticket resolution for more than 2,000 tickets / year, in the following domains:

- SAML Single Sign-on (SSO)
- Access Token scopes, restrictions
- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
- Account lockout procedures
- Email deliverability, automation
- Cost forecasting / management
- GDPR / CCPA, DPA requests
- Pricing model comparisons
- Net 30 ACH invoicing
- Discount policies
- Fraud detection
- ToS compliance

## Certifications

Iâ€™m currently enrolled in a full-time CompTIA Computer User Support course and have passed CompTIA's A+ Core 1 (220-1101) exam. I expect to be fully A+ certified in November 2022.

### Technical writing

As a Product Manager and Support Engineer, I authored new documentation ([Single Sign-on](https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/guides/settings/#single-sign-on-authentication-sso) setup, [Account lockout](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/account-lockout/) + [Collaboration](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/collaboration-best-practices/) guides), and iterated on existing [Accounts & Pricing](https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/guides/) docs based on user feedback / ticket metrics. Internally, I created and updated knowledge base articles for cross-team reference.
